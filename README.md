# Dection of Changepoints in Time Series

This is an implementation of a changpoints detection approach that uses a Decision Tree Regressor.

## Installing the required python packages:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results:
I applied this approach on a dataset downloaded from [bitcoinity.org](https://data.bitcoinity.org),
when running the cpd code like in the ```BitcoinMarketCapExample.py``` we get the following results.
